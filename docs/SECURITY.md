# Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and implementation details for the Product Management System.

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Token Security

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Follow these best practices:

1. **Secret Key Management**:
   - Use a strong, randomly generated secret key (at least 32 characters)
   - Store the secret key securely in environment variables or a secure vault
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - NEVER commit the actual secret key to source control

2. **Token Configuration**:
   - Set appropriate expiration times (default: 60 minutes)
   - Include only necessary claims in the token payload
   - Use HTTPS for all authentication requests
   - Implement token refresh mechanisms

3. **Token Validation**:
   - Validate issuer, audience, and signature on every request
   - Check token expiration
   - Validate token integrity

### Mobile App Security

1. **Secure Token Storage**:
   - Store authentication tokens securely using platform-specific methods
   - Never store tokens in plain text
   - Clear tokens on logout

2. **Session Management**:
   - Implement automatic logout after a period of inactivity
   - Allow users to log out from all devices
   - Handle session expiration gracefully

## Data Protection

### Backend API

1. **Database Security**:
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Limit database user permissions
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement proper connection string security

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Validate all input on the server-side
   - Use model validation attributes
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

3. **Output Encoding**:
   - Encode all output to prevent XSS attacks
   - Set appropriate content-type headers
   - Use proper JSON serialization

### Mobile Application

1. **Local Data Security**:
   - Encrypt the SQLite database
   - Implement secure deletion of sensitive data
   - Don't store credentials in app storage

2. **Secure Communication**:
   - Use certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks
   - Validate server certificates
   - Implement proper error handling for SSL/TLS issues

## Secure Configuration

### Backend API

1. **Web.config Security**:
   - Protect connection strings
   - Use environment transformations for production settings
   - Remove debug and trace information in production

2. **IIS Configuration**:
   - Remove unnecessary HTTP headers
   - Configure proper HTTPS settings
   - Set secure cookie attributes

### Mobile Application

1. **App Permissions**:
   - Request only necessary permissions
   - Provide clear explanations for permission requests
   - Handle permission denial gracefully

2. **Configuration Security**:
   - Don't hard-code sensitive values
   - Use build variants for different environments

## Network Security

1. **HTTPS Implementation**:
   - Enforce HTTPS for all communications
   - Use modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2+)
   - Implement proper certificate management
   - Set up HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

2. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add safeguards against brute force attacks
   - Use API keys for service-to-service communication

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains
   - Limit allowed methods and headers
   - Disable credentials where not needed

## Code Security

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use tools like NuGet Package Manager and npm to track vulnerabilities
   - Remove unused dependencies

2. **Security Testing**:
   - Implement security unit tests
   - Perform regular security code reviews
   - Consider using automated security scanning tools

## Development Best Practices

1. **Secure Development Lifecycle**:
   - Conduct security training for developers
   - Include security in code reviews
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

2. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement centralized error handling
   - Use proper exception handling
   - Log security events but don't expose sensitive information
   - Consider a SIEM solution for security monitoring

3. **Deployment Security**:
   - Use secure deployment pipelines
   - Scan artifacts for vulnerabilities before deployment
   - Implement proper access control for deployment environments

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Identify and isolate affected systems
2. Assess the impact and scope of the breach
3. Notify the security team and management
4. Implement a fix and test thoroughly
5. Restore systems and monitor for any additional suspicious activity
6. Document the incident and update security measures
